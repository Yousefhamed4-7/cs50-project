#### Description: To begin with the reason I chose to build this project is because I was struggling with my school studies especially subjects like social studies and economy these kinds of subject required a lot of memorizing and that was not a very good skill set that I had so I decided to code a simple program first that prompts me with a question that I hard coded into my application and I would open that question everyday until I memorized it that’s when I came up with the idea that I shouldn't hardcode questions and rather have the ability to write questions that would be saved into a database and then I would solve these questions daily to help me memorize them. How the application works is that every user has his own subjects that he creates and his own questions that he creates the structure of the database tables has it so that every question has a property called Solved this property will check if a user has solved this question before if he hasn't then it would be in a list that contains unsolved questions where user can check these questions and solves them so that he should be all caught up with his studies I also created a tab that’s called quiz me this tab will take users quiz type and subject weather it’s all subjects and a specific quiz type or vice versa and there are other types of quizzes that helps user in his studies, I hope this project will help other people as it helped me and thank you CS50 for the journey.
